1.To add two complex numbers:

print("addition of two complex numbers : ",(5+2j)+(3-8j))
output:
8-10j

to subtarct two complex numbers:
print("Subtraction of two complex numbers : ",(5+2j)-(3-8j))
output:
2+10j
to multiply
print("Multiplication of two complex numbers : ",(4+3j)*(3-7j))
output:Multiplication of two complex numbers :  (33-19j)  
to didve
print("Division of two complex numbers : ",(4+3j)/(3-7j))
output:Division of two complex numbers :  (-0.15517241379310348+0.6379310344827587j)

floor division is not possble

modulus operation:
print (abs(3 + 4j)) 
output:5.0 

2.Research on range() functions and its parameters. Create a markdown cell and write in your own words
(no copy-paste from google please) what you understand about it. Implement a small program of your
choice on the same.

range() function syntax is rane(start,stop,step)
start argument is starting number lower limit,it takes zero if not specified
stop argument is upper limit,it doesnt take this number
step argument is difference between each number in the list.
for i in range(5):
    print(i, end=', ')
output:0, 1, 2, 3, 4

3.Consider two numbers. Perform their subtraction and if the result of subtraction is greater than 25, print
their multiplication result else print their division result.

num1 = int(input("Enter First Number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter Second Number: "))
result=num1-num2
print(num1, "-", num2, "=", result)
if result>25:
  result=num1*num2
  print(num1, "*", num2, "=", result)
elif result<25:
  result=num1/num2:
  print(num1, "-", num2, "=", result)
else:
  print("nit defined")
4.Consider a list of 10 elements of integer values. If the number in the list is divisible by 2, print the result as
"square of that number minus 2".

list=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
for i in list:
  if i%2==0:
   result=(i*i)-2
   print ("result")
   
   
  5.Consider a list of 10 elements. Print all the elements in the list which are greater than 7 when that number
is divided 2.

list=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
 for i in list:
  if i>7:
   print(all(i>7 for i/2))
